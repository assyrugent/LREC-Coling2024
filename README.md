# LREC-Coling2024
This repository contains the training and testing files of the paper 'At the Crossroad of Cuneiform and NLP: Challenges for Fine-grained Part-of-speech Tagging' from the LREC-Coling conference in Turin May 2024.
## Data
We provide three datasets that with some manipulation can be used to reproduce our results. They contain the transliterations, i.e. the textual data represented by latin letters, or Unicode cuneiform signs, i.e. a Unicode rendering of the textual data, in the first part of each data line and tab-separated are the Part-of-Speech and morphological information (for further explanation see paper ยง3.5, ยง5.1 and ยง5.3). In order to faciliate proper line separation of the data as experimented in the paper ยง5.2, we have implemented two tags in between lines of text. Those are <EoL> and <EoT>, i{end of line} and i{end of text} respectively.
